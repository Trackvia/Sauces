# Sauces
A repository for shared integrations implemented using microservices on the TrackVia platform. 

This repository is called "Sauces" because the original code name for the project to implement microservices on the TrackVia platform was called "Hot Sauce." As you can imagine this lead to all sorts of puns. We started calling each microservice a sauce and would talk about "putting some sauce on that" or "we're going to need some extra hot sauce for this."
