# Sauces

Welcome to Sauces, a repository for shared integrations implemented using microservices on the TrackVia platform.  We chose the name "Sauces" to align with our original code name for the project, "Hot Sauce." 

As you can imagine, this lead to all sorts of witty puns. As the project evolved, we started calling each microservice a sauce in such contexts like "put some sauce on that" or "we're going to need some extra hot sauce for this."

## Getting Started

Please feel free to use and modify the code here to meet your needs. All code within this project is contributed from various sources and is provided as is with no warranty, so use at your own risk. For more information see our [license](https://github.com/Trackvia/Sauces/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Contributing

If you would like to add your sauce to the mix, please issue a pull request. We ask that you follow the directory structure you see here, i.e, keeping each sauce in its own directory from the root. 

Please make sure you remove any usernames, passwords, or private keys from the source files and do not include any libraries or binary files that can be installed using `npm install` or the like. 

Also, please add a `README.md` at the root of each sauce so others have a clear understanding of your sauce's purpose and how it can be used.

Thanks,

TrackVia.
