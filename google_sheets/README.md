# Google Sheets Integration

This sauce matches a value from a record to a cell in a google sheet.  Once the
cell is matched, the data in the extra columns of the sheet is used to update
values back in TrackVia


You'll need to update the following constants:
```javaScript
const API_KEY = '12345';
const USERNAME = 'demo@trackvia.com';
const PASSWORD = 'Test1234';
const VIEW_ID=1111;
const SPREADSHEET_ID='1-lkjiusdfasUlalkhaadsfsvnqu'
```
